Air Quality Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning models. The goal is to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various factors such as weather data, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This project is intended for understanding the environmental impacts of air quality and can be used to forecast future pollution levels.

Problem Statement
Air pollution is a major concern in urban areas around the world, affecting the health of millions of people. Predicting air quality can help governments and organizations take preemptive measures to protect public health. This model uses historical air quality data and environmental factors to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI), providing valuable insights into the air quality and its potential future trends.

Features
Historical Air Quality Data: A dataset containing air quality measurements like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and AQI values.
Weather Features: Data related to temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Prediction Models: Machine learning models like Random Forest and Linear Regression are trained to predict AQI based on the environmental factors.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

date: Date of the measurement.
temp: Temperature (Â°C).
humidity: Humidity percentage.
windspeed: Wind speed (m/s).
pm2.5: Particulate matter PM2.5 concentration.
pm10: Particulate matter PM10 concentration.
co: Carbon monoxide concentration.
no2: Nitrogen dioxide concentration.
aqi: Air Quality Index (target variable).
The dataset can be downloaded from Zindi platform.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Preprocess the data to clean it and handle missing values.
Use machine learning models to predict AQI values.
Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for data processing and modeling.
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and model evaluation.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and testing.
